# BrikByte Studios — Org-wide Governance Policy (PIPE-GOV-7.1)
#
# This file defines the **baseline governance policy** for BrikByte-Studios.
# Product / service repos MAY define their own .github/policy.yml, but:
#   - They MUST conform to docs/policy/policy.schema.json
#   - They SHOULD be at least as strict as this baseline (see policy-validate.js lint rules)
